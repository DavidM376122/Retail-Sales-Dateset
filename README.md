# Retail-Sales-Dateset
This is my project Retail Sales Dataset.
This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset using **Microsoft Excel** to derive key insights. The goal of the analysis was to explore the data and generate meaningful insights that can help the retail business make data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** 📈
- Excel Functions:
  - `SUM` ➕
  - `AVERAGE` 🔢
  - `UNIQUE` 🆕
  - `VLOOKUP` 🔍
  - `SUMIF` and `SUMIFS` 🧮
  - Cell Referencing 🔗
  - **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts** 📊
  - **Slicers** 🔄

## 📑 Data Analysis Process
The retail sales dataset was analyzed using a variety of Excel functions, pivot tables, and visualizations to gain insights on total sales, commissions, and other key metrics. Here’s a breakdown of the steps I took:

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed any duplicates and irrelevant rows.
   - Ensured consistency across date formats and columns.

2. **Summarizing Data**:
   - Used `SUM` to calculate total sales and commissions for each item.
   - Applied `AVERAGE` to find the average sales per item.
   - Utilized `UNIQUE` to identify distinct items in the dataset.
   
3. **Advanced Functions**:
   - `VLOOKUP` was used to pull information from different sheets.
   - `SUMIF` and `SUMIFS` helped in calculating sales and commission based on specific conditions (e.g., sales by region, category, or salesperson).

4. **Creating New Columns**:
   - **Commission**: A column was created to calculate the commission earned based on sales values.
   - **Total Sales**: A column was added to calculate total sales per item, integrating both original sales and any additional commissions.

5. **Pivot Table & Chart**:
   - Created **Pivot Tables** to summarize the sales data by region, salesperson, and product category.
   - Generated **Pivot Charts** to visually represent these summaries, making it easier to spot trends.

6. **Data Interactivity**:
   - Used **Slicers** to create interactive filters for easy data exploration in Pivot Tables.

## 💡 Insights
From the analysis, several key insights were derived, such as:
- Best-performing product categories.
- Sales trends by month and year.
- Commission breakdown per salesperson.
